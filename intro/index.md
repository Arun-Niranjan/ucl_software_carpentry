* Helps researchers be more productive by teaching them basic computing skills:
    * program construction
    * version control
    * testing
    * the command line
    * data management
* Volunteer organization supported by the [Alfred P. Sloan Foundation](http://www.sloan.org/) and the [Mozilla Foundation](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/foundation/).
* Provides online training materials and run boots camps like this one.

## Why is Software Carpentry needed?

* Scientists increasingly use computers for their work, but often they do not do so effectively:
    * not familiar with software development techniques
    * carry out repetitive tasks by hand
* Traditionally programming courses for scientists:
    * focus on language syntax rather than general principles
    * assume you will learn not to make mistakes
* Current climate favours
    * big data
    * parallel computing for speed
    * ...but *correctness* is overlooked, or taken for granted

## Software Carpentry aims to fill in the gaps

* learn lessons from software engineering practice, and empirical studies
* start with most important practical steps: software *carpentry*

## Best Practices for Scientific Computing

* Greg Wilson and 12 others: [http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.0530](http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.0530)
* Ten rules to support *correct*, *reproducible* results:
    1. Write programs for people, not computers
    1. Automate repetitive tasks
    1. Use the computer to record history
    1. Make incremental changes
    1. Use version control
    1. Don't repeat yourself (or others)
    1. Plan for mistakes
    1. Optimize software only after it works correctly
    1. Document design and purpose, not mechanics
    1. Collaborate
